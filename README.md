Write a program that creates a file with ordered records containing a set of fixed-length fields. The first field contains the index (sequence number).
All records in the file should be written sequentially according to their indices. In case a record with a certain index is missing, its place in the file should be reserved with the character with code 0.
Create a file on disk of size N records.
Write an array of records to the file according to their indices.
